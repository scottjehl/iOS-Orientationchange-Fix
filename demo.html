<h1>Test page for ios-orientationchange-fix.js</h1>

<p>This page is a demo of a bugfix for the iOS orientation change bug, in which the page zooms beyond the viewport on orientationchange when user scaling is enabled. Summary below.</p>


<h2>Summary of bug</h2>
<p>When the meta viewport tag is set to content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1", or any value that allows user-scaling, changing the device to landscape orientation causes the page to scale larger than 1.0. As a result, a portion of the page is cropped off the right, and the user must double-tap (sometimes more than once) to get the page to zoom properly into view.</p>

<p>When switching to portrait mode, the layout adapts perfectly. The issue only occurs in landscape.
If the content attribute is adjusted with either user-scalable=no or maximum-scale=1, the problem goes away, but then scaling is disabled, which is undesirable.</p>

<h2>Steps to Reproduce: </h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open this page in portrait orientation on an iOS device or emulator.</li>
	<li>Change to landscape orientation</li>
</ol>

<h2>Expected Results:</h2>
<p>The page should remain scaled at 1.0, and the page width should shrink to fit the viewport.</p>

<h2>Actual Results (without included fix):</h2>
<p>The page is zoomed past 1.0, cropping a portion of the page from view and causing the content to be much too large.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Developers should not have to disable user-scaling to enable smooth changes in orientation.</p>
